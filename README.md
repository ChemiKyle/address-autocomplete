# Address Autocomplete External Module

The Address Autocomplete module allows an address field to be autocompleted using the Google Maps API. Address is then saved into Street Number, Street, City, Zip code, County, State and Country fields along with latitude and longitude if desired. 

## Setting up the module

This module requires a Google API Key in order to connect to Google Maps. This can be obtained by following the instructions here: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
